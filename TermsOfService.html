Digital Documentation Disclaimer
The Services may include features that allow users to generate, store, or share digital warranty cards or related documentation for informational purposes. These digital warranty records are intended solely as convenience tools and do not constitute official or legally binding agreements.

Outer Snail Productions, LLC does not verify, validate, or enforce any warranty information entered or generated through the Services. The accuracy, completeness, and enforceability of any warranty details are the sole responsibility of the user and the issuing business, dealership, or service provider.

All official warranty terms, conditions, and coverage are governed by the policies of the respective dealership, manufacturer, or service provider. Users are encouraged to consult directly with the issuing party to confirm warranty validity and scope. Outer Snail Productions, LLC shall not be liable for any disputes, claims, or misunderstandings arising from the use or presentation of digital warranty records generated by the Services.

WE MAKE NO WARRANTY THAT THE SERVICES WILL BE AVAILABLE ERROR FREE OR THAT THE SERVICES OR THE CONTENT ARE FREE OF COMPUTER VIRUSES OR SIMILAR CONTAMINATION OR DESTRUCTIVE FEATURES. IF YOUR USE OF THE SERVICES OR THE CONTENT RESULTS IN THE NEED FOR SERVICING OR REPLACING EQUIPMENT OR DATA, WE SHALL NOT BE RESPONSIBLE FOR THOSE COSTS.

THE SERVICES AND CONTENT ARE PROVIDED ON AN “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE” BASIS WITHOUT ANY WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND. WE HEREBY DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE WARRANTY OF TITLE, MERCHANTABILITY, NON INFRINGEMENT OF THIRD PARTIES’ RIGHTS, AND WEIGHT AND BODY COMPOSITION DATA FOR PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

IN NO EVENT SHALL WE BE LIABLE FOR ANY DAMAGES (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, INCIDENTAL AND CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, LOST PROFITS, OR DAMAGES RESULTING FROM LOST DATA OR BUSINESS INTERRUPTION) RESULTING FROM THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE SERVICES AND THE CONTENT, WHETHER BASED ON WARRANTY, CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), OR ANY OTHER LEGAL THEORY, IN EXCESS OF ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS, EVEN IF WE HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

Some states do not allow exclusion of implied warranties or limitation of liability for incidental or consequential damages, so the above limitations or exclusions may not apply to you. IN SUCH STATES, OUR LIABILITY SHALL BE LIMITED TO THE GREATEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW.

Force Majeure
We shall not be held liable for any failure or delay in performance of our obligations due to events beyond our reasonable control, including but not limited to acts of God, natural disasters, war, terrorism, civil unrest, labor shortages, or failure of suppliers, internet service providers, or telecommunications systems.

Dispute Resolution
You agree that any dispute, claim, or controversy arising out of or relating to these Terms or your use of the Services will be settled by binding arbitration in accordance with the rules of the American Arbitration Association. The arbitration will be held in Maricopa County, Arizona. You agree to waive any right to a jury trial or to participate in a class action.

Nothing in this section shall prevent either party from seeking equitable or injunctive relief in a court of competent jurisdiction.

Payment
Some of the JobPop services including future services may require your fee payment. All fees must be paid in U.S. dollars using a valid credit card, PayPal®, or any other payment method we accept at the time of purchase.

By providing payment information, you authorize us (or our third-party payment processor) to charge the applicable amount to your chosen payment method. You are solely responsible for any applicable taxes, fees, or surcharges imposed related to your use of paid services.

If you believe you have been charged in error, you must notify us in writing within thirty (30) days of the charge date. After this period, you waive any right to dispute the charge.

We reserve the right to modify pricing at any time, but we will provide advance notice before any changes take effect for existing subscriptions or services.

General
These Terms of Use, and any rights and licenses granted hereunder, may not be transferred or assigned by you, but may be assigned by us without restriction.

These Terms of Use are governed by the laws of the State of Arizona, without respect to its conflict of law provisions. If any provision of these Terms of Use is found to be invalid by any court having competent jurisdiction, the invalidity of such provision shall not affect the validity of the remaining provisions of the Terms of Use, which shall remain in full force and effect. Failure by us to act on or enforce any provision of the Terms of Use shall not be construed as a waiver of that provision or any other provision in these Terms of Use. No waiver shall be effective against us unless made in writing, and no such waiver shall be construed as a waiver in any other or subsequent instance. Except as expressly agreed by us and you, these Terms of Use constitute the entire agreement between you and us with respect to the subject matter, and supersede all previous or contemporaneous agreements, whether written or oral, between the parties with respect to the subject matter. The section headings are provided merely for convenience and shall not be given any legal import. These Terms of Use will insure to the benefit of our successors, assigns, licensees, and sublicensees.

Changes to the Services
We reserve the right to modify, suspend, or discontinue the Services, or any part thereof, at any time without notice. We are not liable to you or any third party for any modification, suspension, or discontinuation of the Services.
