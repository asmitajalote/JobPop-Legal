  <h2>Introduction</h2>

  </p>
  <p>

  </p>

    <li><strong>Usage Data</strong> – Used for analytics and performance improvement</li>
    <li><strong>Identifiers</strong> – Used for marketing or tracking (if applicable)</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Third-Party Services and SDKs</h2>
  <p>
    We may use services like Firebase, Google Analytics, or Facebook SDK. These providers handle data according to their own privacy policies.
    You may manage app permissions via device settings. Contact us at <a href="mailto:contact@outersnail.com">contact@outersnail.com</a> for questions.
  </p>

  <h2>Data Retention and Deletion</h2>
  <p>We retain information for as long as reasonably necessary to deliver our Services to you or to fulfill the purposes described in this Policy.

This provides you with the ability to review your activities over time, track your progress toward personal goals and challenges, and remember your past achievements and milestones (for example, your weight loss goals or other personal achievements).
  </p>
  <p>
    Because our users may take extended breaks from using scales and may use our Apps on various devices, we do not delete information automatically based on account inactivity or when you uninstall our Apps from one of your devices.

We will post any revised Privacy Policy on our website with an “effective date” indicating when the changes will take effect. We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy periodically, and especially before you provide any Personal, Business, Vendor or Customer Data.
